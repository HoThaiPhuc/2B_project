# I.Introduction
In the fields of healthcare and laboratory work, it is essential for most people to have a medical device to assist them in their tasks and research. The purpose of this project is to introduce a medical device used for delivering medication or chemicals, with a controlled flow rate over a specified time period, requiring high accuracy and technical precision. This device is the syringe pump, which is a combination of several components such as motor, syringe, pump controller, sensors, and LCD. Below are the detailed information about our group's final project.
